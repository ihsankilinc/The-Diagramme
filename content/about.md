I am a 24 year old computer engineer living in Turkey. I usually post on topics that interest me. These are mostly about web & mobile application development. Software programming is a painful process. Teaching while learning is a great way to improve yourself and make your life easier. Hope it will be useful to you all.

Feel free to ask me anything and give your feedback about shared topics. If you see any mistakes made in these posts let me know and I will fix it. You can contact me via mail adress;
